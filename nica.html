            Living in the Information Technology Era explores the science, culture, and ethics of information technology (IT);
            its various uses and applications; and its influence on culture and society. It also aims to strike a balance between
            conceptual instruction and socially and culturally oriented discussions, as it not only explains the basic concepts or
            key terms in IT but also features the major IT trends along with the issues and challenges these developments bring.
            Divided into six chapters, this textbook uses the outcome-based approach with assessment tests and tasks to effectively measure student learning.
            It is hoped that through this material, more knowledgeable and responsible young netizens who can maximize the benefits of information technology
            without compromising values and ethics will be developed.
